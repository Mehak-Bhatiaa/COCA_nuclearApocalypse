IE phase 1: start: intro: nightclub? Music starts staticking? More daily activities?
IE phase 2: pass a certain point trigger: escape plan (run through city? What activities?)? Screen shake. Evacuation noises. 
IE phase 3: post-death end screen: groundhog’s day time loop? Generic “You died” with mushroom cloud explosion in background?

Timeline, End of March: All assets together, cityscape built, figure out bomb manipulation, have nightclub opening
